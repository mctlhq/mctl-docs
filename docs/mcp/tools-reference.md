## mctl-agents pipeline controls

> **Admin-only.** All tools in this section require membership in the `admins` group.
> Calls from non-admin users return `403 Forbidden`.
>
> _Version note: available as of mctl-api 4.15.0 (commit `016b3c8`) and 4.16.0 (`f41590e`).
> version-status: unverified — confirm against production before relying on this page._

The mctl platform runs a daily autonomous R&D pipeline (`mctl-agents`) that scans sibling
repos for changes, identifies documentation gaps, and writes spec proposals — one cycle per
service (researcher → analyst → spec-writer). A Tier 2 implementer can also convert accepted
proposals into pull requests automatically.

The seven tools below let platform admins drive this pipeline on demand from any MCP-capable
client (e.g. Claude Desktop, Claude Code).

### Tool summary

| Tool | Purpose | Returns | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mctl_trigger_agents_run` | Full pipeline — all service-agents + mentor digest | `workflow_name` | Write |
| `mctl_trigger_mentor_only` | Mentor weekly digest only | `workflow_name` | Write |
| `mctl_trigger_single_service` | One service-agent cycle | `workflow_name` | Write |
| `mctl_list_recent_agent_runs` | List ≤10 recent pipeline runs from audit log | `{ "items": [...], "count": N }` | Read |
| `mctl_trigger_implementer` | Tier 2: open PRs for accepted proposals | `workflow_name` | Destructive |
| `mctl_trigger_shepherd` | Tier 3: drive open implementer PRs through review and merge | `workflow_name` | Destructive |
| `mctl_trigger_incident_responder` | Diagnose stuck TypeGeneric incidents into auto-accepted proposals, then resolve them | `workflow_name` | Write |
| `mctl_trigger_issue` | Turn a GitHub issue (mctlhq org) into a spec-driven proposal via the issue-investigator | `workflow_name` | Write |

---

### `mctl_trigger_agents_run`

Triggers a full mctl-agents run: every service-agent (researcher → analyst → spec-writer
in parallel) followed by the mentor weekly digest. Equivalent to the daily 06:00 UTC cron,
but on demand.

**Parameters:** none

**Cost / duration:** ~$10 against Claude subscription quota; ~15 minutes.

**Result:** A `chore(agents)` commit lands in `mctl-gitops` main under
`platform-gitops/agents-state/` with new inbox files, proposals, and updated `.status.yaml`
entries.

**Returns:** `workflow_name` string — use with `mctl_get_workflow_status` to track progress.

```
mctl_trigger_agents_run()
# → { "workflow_name": "mctl-agents-daily-abc12" }
```

---

### `mctl_trigger_mentor_only`

Runs only the mentor sub-agent, which reads all service inbox files from the past week and
produces a cross-service digest. Lighter than the full run.

**Parameters:** none

**Cost / duration:** ~$2, ~5 minutes.

**Returns:** `workflow_name`

---

### `mctl_trigger_single_service`

Runs the researcher → analyst → spec-writer cycle for a single service only.
Useful for spot-checking one repo after a significant release.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | string (enum) | yes | One of: `mctl-web`, `mctl-openclaw`, `mctl-docs`, `mctl-api`, `mctl-portal`, `mctl-agent`, `mctl-gitops` |

**Cost / duration:** ~$2–5, ~5–10 minutes.

**Returns:** `workflow_name`

**Example:**

```
mctl_trigger_single_service(service="mctl-docs")
# → { "workflow_name": "mctl-agents-single-xyz99" }
```

---

### `mctl_list_recent_agent_runs`

Returns up to 10 recent mctl-agents pipeline runs from the audit log, enriched with the
run mode and target service so you don't need to parse the workflow name.

**Parameters:** none

**Returns:** JSON object `{ "items": [...], "count": N }` where each item has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `workflowName` | Argo workflow name (use for status polling) |
| `operation` | Operation name (`mctl-agents-run`, `mctl-agents-implement`, …) |
| `mode` | Run mode (`full`, `mentor-only`, `single-service`) |
| `service` | Target service (empty for full/mentor runs) |
| `status` | Last known status (`running`, `succeeded`, `failed`) |
| `user` | Admin user ID who triggered the run |
| `timestamp` | ISO8601 start time |
| `riskLevel` | `high` for all mctl-agents triggers |
| `message` | Short status message |

---

### `mctl_trigger_implementer`

Triggers Tier 2 implementer agents. The implementer scans
`platform-gitops/agents-state/<service>/proposals/<slug>/.status.yaml` for entries with
`status: accepted`. For each accepted proposal it:

1. Clones the matching `mctlhq/<service>` repo.
2. Runs the per-service implementer sub-agent to make the change.
3. Pushes a `feat/agents-<slug>` branch and opens a PR.
4. Updates `.status.yaml` to `status: implemented` with the PR URL.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | string (enum) | no | Filter to one service. Leave empty to process all services. Same enum as `mctl_trigger_single_service`. |
| `slug` | string | no | Filter to one proposal slug (across services unless `service` is also set). |
| `force` | `"true"` \| `"false"` | no | Retry proposals stuck in `in-progress` (e.g. from a crashed run). Default `"false"`. |

**Cost / duration:** ~$3 per proposal; 1–10 minutes per proposal.

**Returns:** `workflow_name`

**Example — implement one specific proposal:**

```
mctl_trigger_implementer(service="mctl-docs", slug="mcp-agents-tools")
# → { "workflow_name": "mctl-agents-implement-abc34" }
```

---

### `mctl_trigger_shepherd`

Triggers the Tier 3 PR shepherd. The shepherd scans every open PR opened by the
implementer (`feat/agents-*` branches in `mctlhq/mctl-*` repos) and advances each one
toward merge:

1. Reads the latest Codex review state for the PR.
2. If P1/P2 findings are present, runs the per-service implementer sub-agent to push a
   fix-up commit addressing the feedback.
3. If the review is clean and CI is green, merges the PR with `--merge --delete-branch`
   and flips the proposal's `.status.yaml` to `status: merged`.
4. If the proposal is unsalvageable (repeated review failures, or Codex flags a hard
   blocker), it closes the PR and flips the status to `status: rejected`.

The shepherd also runs autonomously on a `30 */2 * * *` UTC cron, so on-demand triggers
are mainly for "I just merged a fix, advance the queue now" cases.

**Parameters:** none

**Cost / duration:** ~$1–5 per active PR; 2–15 minutes total per run.

**Concurrency:** Contends on the `mctl-gitops-main-writes` Argo mutex with the
implementer and other gitops-writing workflows, so two runs cannot overlap.

**Returns:** `workflow_name`

```
mctl_trigger_shepherd()
# → { "workflow_name": "mctl-agents-shepherd-xyz78" }
```

---

### `mctl_trigger_incident_responder`

Triggers the incident responder: diagnoses TypeGeneric incidents stuck in
`status=analyzing` for more than 30 minutes, writes auto-accepted proposals
(`requirements.md` / `design.md` / `tasks.md` + `.status.yaml` with
`status: accepted`) under `platform-gitops/agents-state/<service>/proposals/incident-<id>/`
for the Tier 2 implementer to pick up, then resolves the matched incidents.
Same as the every-30-minute cron (`15,45 * * * *` UTC), on demand. Admin-only.

**Parameters:** none

**Cost / duration:** ~$2 per run (subscription quota), max 5 incidents per run; up to ~10 minutes.

**Returns:** `workflow_name` — poll `mctl_get_workflow_status` or
`mctl_list_recent_agent_runs` for progress.

---

### `mctl_trigger_issue`

Triggers the mctl-agents issue-investigator to turn a GitHub issue into a spec-driven
proposal. Given an issue URL under the `mctlhq` org, the investigator reads the issue,
clones the target repo read-only to ground the design in real code, and writes
`requirements.md` / `design.md` / `tasks.md` plus a `.status.yaml` (`status: proposed`)
under `platform-gitops/agents-state/<service>/proposals/<slug>/`. It then comments the
proposal link back on the issue.

The proposal stops at `status: proposed` and awaits human approval — review the spec and
flip `.status.yaml` to `accepted` before the Tier 2 implementer
(`mctl_trigger_implementer`) picks it up. No PR is opened by this step, which is why the
tool is annotated Write rather than Destructive.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `issue_url` | yes | Full GitHub issue URL under the mctlhq org, e.g. `https://github.com/mctlhq/mctl-telegram/issues/123` |

**Cost / duration:** ~$3 against Claude subscription quota; ~5–10 minutes.

**Result:** a new proposal directory committed to `mctl-gitops` main, plus a comment on
the issue.

**Returns:** `workflow_name` string — use with `mctl_get_workflow_status` or
`mctl_list_recent_agent_runs` to track progress.

### Status polling

All trigger tools return a `workflow_name`. Poll for progress with:

```
mctl_get_workflow_status(workflow_name="mctl-agents-daily-abc12")
```

Or check the last few runs at any time:

```
mctl_list_recent_agent_runs()
```

Results also appear as `chore(agents)` commits in the `mctl-gitops` repository under
`platform-gitops/agents-state/`.
